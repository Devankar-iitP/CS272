# CS272
During the course of my academic journey, in the second year, I was privileged to undertake the **CS272** course. This course served as a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental aspects of **Data Analytics using R and Tableau**. It provided me with a robust understanding of the basic principles and methodologies employed in the analysis of data.

It taught me one of the significant data handling languages, the **R language**. This language, renowned for its application in statistical computing and graphics, became a vital tool in my data analysis toolkit.

In addition to this, the course introduced me to the dynamic platform of **Tableau**. This platform, known for its interactive data visualization capabilities, significantly enhanced my ability to interpret and present data in a more engaging and understandable manner.
